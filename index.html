        <h2>Why Hedgehogz are cool</h2>
        <p>Hedgehogs are cool because of their unique blend of cuteness, curiosity, and defense mechanisms. 
            Their spiky exterior gives them a distinct, armored appearance, but underneath, they are gentle and surprisingly 
            social animals. When threatened, they curl into an adorable, protective ball, a behavior that's both fascinating 
            and practical. Despite their prickly look, they are playful and fun to watch as they explore their surroundings. 
            Hedgehogs are also low-maintenance pets, making them a favorite for animal lovers. Their quirky personality and 
            tough-yet-cuddly vibe make them stand out as cool creatures!</p>
